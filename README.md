## Introduction

Todayâ€™s modern customers value an end-to-end real-time experience.

They need access to data in motion.

We welcome you to join Confluent team in a workshop to get started with data in motion. Each session includes a virtual guided workshop on how you can use Confluent Cloud to explore event-driven architectures and how these measured and well-informed architectural decisions result in successful outcomes.
